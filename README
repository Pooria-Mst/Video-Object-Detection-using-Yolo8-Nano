## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `video-object-detection-using-yolo8-nano.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.
- `README.md` â€“ Project description and usage guide.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Implements YOLOv8 Nano for lightweight object detection.
- Works on video files (can be extended to live camera streams).
- Uses `ultralytics` library for YOLOv8.
- Suitable for real-time applications due to its efficiency.
